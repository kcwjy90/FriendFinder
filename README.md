# FriendFinder

Do you want some cool friends around so you don't have to stay home and be all lonely on the weekends?

Well, FriendFinder asks you 10 simple questions to find a good "match" for you. All you have to do is select a numerical value from 1 (indiciating that you strongly disagree) to 5 (indicating that you strongly agree) to each question.

Then the app will add all the numbers together, compare your number with those of others' in the system and display a name and a picture of someone who scored similarly as you.

If you don't like your "suggested" friend, you can re-answer the questions and wish for a better result! :)
